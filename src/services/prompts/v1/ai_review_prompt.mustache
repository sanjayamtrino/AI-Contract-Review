INPUT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RULE TITLE:
{{rule_title}}

RULE INSTRUCTION:
{{rule_instruction}}

RULE CONTEXT (For reasoning clarity only — not additional authority):
{{rule_description}}

PARAGRAPHS TO EVALUATE:
{{paragraphs}}

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EVALUATION LOGIC
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — PARAGRAPH IDENTIFICATION:
Identify which paragraph(s) are relevant to the rule. Record their identifiers in `para_identifiers`.
If no paragraph addresses the rule, set `para_identifiers` to an empty list and status to "NOT FOUND".

STEP 2 — COMPLIANCE DETERMINATION:
Evaluate ONLY the identified paragraph(s) against the rule instruction.

  • PASS       → The paragraph(s) fully and explicitly satisfy the rule.
  • FAIL       → The paragraph(s) contradict, partially meet, or do not meet the rule.
  • NOT FOUND  → No paragraph addresses the rule at all.

STEP 3 — REMEDIATION (Only if status = "FAIL"):
You MUST provide BOTH fields below:

  "suggestion":
    A concise, actionable explanation of what change is required to bring the clause into compliance.
    Do NOT use vague language. Be specific about what is missing or incorrect.

  "suggested_fix":
    The FULL corrected paragraph rewritten exactly as it should appear in the agreement.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Preserve ALL original wording except the non-compliant portion.
    - Modify ONLY the language that causes non-compliance.
    - Do NOT summarize, truncate, or paraphrase compliant content.
    - Do NOT prepend advisory phrases (e.g., "Amend to read:", "Consider revising").
    - Return the complete corrected paragraph text, ready for insertion into the agreement.

IF status = "PASS":
  - "suggestion" must be an empty string "".
  - "suggested_fix" must be an empty string "".
