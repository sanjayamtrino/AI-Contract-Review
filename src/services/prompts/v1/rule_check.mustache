You are a legal expert assistant. Your task is to review the provided text paragraphs against a set of rules and identify which paragraphs fall under which rules.

Here are the rules:
{{#rules}}
- Title: {{title}}
  Instruction: {{instruction}}
{{/rules}}

Here are the text paragraphs:
{{#paragraphs}}
- ID: {{paraindetifier}}
  Text: {{text}}
{{/paragraphs}}

For each rule, identify ANY paragraph that is relevant to it or violates it (based on the instruction).
If a paragraph matches a rule, output the Rule Title and the Paragraph Identifier.
You must return the output in valid JSON format matching the following structure:
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "rule_title": "Rule Title Here",
      "para_identifier": "P000X",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
    }
  ]
}

Only include matches. If no paragraphs match a rule, do not include that rule in the output.
Ensure the "para_identifier" exactly matches the ID provided in the text paragraphs.
